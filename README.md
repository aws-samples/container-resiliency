# container-resiliency 🚀

## Goal

The primary goal of container resiliency respository focused on Amazon EKS and Amazon ECS is to provide a comprehensive guide and patterns for organizations to design, deploy, and operate highly resilient and fault-tolerant containerized applications on AWS. These patterns aims to provide the knowledge and practical guidance necessary to mitigate risks, minimize downtime, and ensure the continuous availability and resilience of containerized applications on AWS, ultimately enhancing their overall operational efficiency and customer experience.

## Tenets

1. High Availability and Fault Tolerance
2. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
3. Scalability and Resource Optimization
4. Monitoring, Logging, and Observability
5. Security and Compliance
